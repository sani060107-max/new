      <p>Pilgrims enter the state of Ihram at the Miqat, perform Niyyah (intention), and recite the prescribed duas. Travel to Mina and settle for the night. Pilgrims begin their sacred journey by donning the Ihram and moving to Mina, 
        a valley that becomes alive with tents and prayers. Here, they prepare themselves 
        spiritually with continuous Talbiyah, heartfelt supplications, and reflection. 
        The atmosphere is filled with brotherhood and equality, reminding pilgrims that this 
        is a journey of unity and humility in front of Allah.</p>

      <p>Travel to Arafat, spend the afternoon in supplication and prayer. This is the most important day of Hajj. The Day of Arafat is the heart of Hajj. Pilgrims gather on the plains of Arafat, 
        standing in sincere devotion under the open sky. Here, they listen to the Khutbah 
        and spend their time in Dua, seeking forgiveness and mercy. It is said that no day 
        holds more blessings, and every pilgrim feels the closeness of Allah as they pour 
        out their hopes and sorrows.</p>

The overnight stay is a significant stage of the pilgrimage, representing humility and preparing for the final rituals.Pilgrims spend the night under the open sky in Muzdalifah, collecting pebbles for 
        the symbolic stoning of the devil. This simple act strengthens their resolve against 
        temptation. At dawn, they return to Mina, where they perform the stoning of Jamarat, 
        a powerful reminder of Prophet Ibrahim‚Äôs steadfastness. Sacrifice (Qurbani) is also 
        offered, symbolizing obedience and gratitude to Allah.</p>

      <p>Return to Mecca, perform Tawaf Al-Wada (farewell circumambulation) around the Ka'bah, completing the Hajj pilgrimage.The final day of Hajj is a bittersweet moment of farewell. Pilgrims perform the 
        Tawaf al-Wida around the Kaaba, bidding goodbye to the sacred sanctuary. Each step
